## Abstract ##

The Counterparty Devs should be able to issue tokens for voting to all XCP holders to initiate a vote (for example for a protocol change).

## Motivation ##

With the lack of PoW 'voting' by miners there's no good way to reach / poll for consensus on changes to the protocol that aren't completely uncontroversial.

## Rationale ##

Being able to let all XCP owners vote on a particular issue by sending out a voting token and providing a list of addresses to send the token to can be very useful to poll the consensus / desire of the community.

The votes done with these tokens are not part of this CIP and the initial intention is not to have other protocol changes activate automatically based on these votes,
though that could be a future CIP if there's a reason to do so.

## Specification ##

We will re-enable (it has been disabled in the past) sending dividends to XCP holders, but only when the source is a multisig address consisting of keys held by group of devs / board members.

Currently the community is 'close' enough to asume most people will be aware of any voting through the community forums and slack channel,
in the future we could add something to the software to pop up a notification (triggered through a broadcast) with some information about any votes.

### Multi-Signature Keys ###
To prevent the need for an immediate update, I suggest at least a 4 keys and to keep it at least `n = m - 1`.

## Backwards Compatibility ##

Old clients will not recognise any tokens issued through dividends to XCP in this way,
this could enable the issuer to double spend the tokens against the old clients after selling them on the DEX.
As usual the activation will be after a reasonable block height after the release of the code to support this to allow for a window of time for nodes to upgrade.
We could also assume that the tokens won't be traded on the DEX, but depending on the stake of the vote they might be.
